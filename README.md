## Data Types in Java

> [!WARNING]
> Java Is a Strongly Typed Language

### Primitive data types
Java denes eight primitive types of data: byte, short, int, long, char, float, double, and boolean. 
The primitive types are also commonly referred to as simple types.

#### Integers 
This group includes byte, short, int, and long,
which are for whole-valued signed numbers.

#### Floating-point numbers 
This group includes float and double, which represent numbers with fractional precision.

#### Characters 
This group includes char, which represents symbols in a character set, like letters and numbers.

#### Boolean 
This group includes boolean, which is a special type for representing true/false values.
